                        Creating a Branch:
Go to your repository on GitHub.
Click the "Branch" dropdown and select "New branch".
Enter a branch name (e.g., "feature/new-login-system").
Choose a base branch (usually "main" or "master").  
                        Making Changes:
Switch to your new branch using git checkout <branch-name>.
Make changes to your code, committing them as needed.
Push changes to your branch on GitHub using git push origin <branch-name>.
                      Merging a Branch:
Switch to the main branch using git checkout main.
Pull the latest changes from GitHub using git pull origin main.
Merge your branch into the main branch using git merge <branch-name>.
Resolve conflicts (if any) and commit the merge.
Push the updated main branch to GitHub using git push origin main.
                      Best Practices:
Use descriptive branch names.
Keep branches up-to-date with the main branch.
Use pull requests for code review and discussion.
Delete branches after merging to keep the repository clean.

Pull Requests and Code Reviews:
What is a pull request in GitHub, and how does it facilitate code reviews and collaboration? Outline the steps to create and review a pull request.

GitHub Actions:
Explain what GitHub Actions are and how they can be used to automate workflows. Provide an example of a simple CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions.

GitHub Actions is a continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) tool that allows you to automate workflows directly within your GitHub repository. It enables you to create custom workflows that automate tasks such as:
Building and testing code
Deploying applications
Sending notifications
Creating releases
                              Automating Workflows with GitHub Actions
GitHub Actions uses YAML files to define workflows, which are triggered by specific events such as push, pull request, or schedule. Each workflow consists of one or more jobs, which are executed in a virtual environment.
Example: Simple CI/CD Pipeline using GitHub Actions
Here's an example of a simple CI/CD pipeline that builds and deploys a Node.js application:
.github/workflows/nodejs.yml
YAML
name: Node.js CI/CD

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Build and test
        run: npm run build && npm run test

      - name: Deploy to production
        uses: actions/deploy-to-aws@v1
        with:
          aws-access-key-id: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
          aws-secret-access-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
          bucket-name: my-bucket
          deploy-path: /
    This workflow:
Triggers on push events to the main branch
Checks out the code
Installs dependencies
Builds and tests the application
Deploys to an AWS S3 bucket using environment secrets
Benefits of GitHub Actions
Tight integration with GitHub repositories
Easy setup and configuration
Customizable workflows
Scalable and flexible
Cost-effective
